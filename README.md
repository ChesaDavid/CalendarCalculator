# About
- Overview
    >"The two most powrful warriors are patiance and time" -Leo Tolstoy
The project CalendarCalculator it was started from a thought that I had at a random time
"How much is it untill a cartain date" so I new I had to make a code that do exactly that 
so I can know exactly how much time I had.
- The prosses
    It was realy fast to finish this project even tho I have another project going on and so this wasn't my main focus
- Personal take on the project
    It is on the 
    ````bash
    AndThatIsIt!.md
    `````
    file

# For-the-future
I want to implement a feature to calculate how much time passed from a chosed date to another chosed date
